# Ruby-on-Rails

## Description

This repository serves as a practice directory for Ruby on Rails, aligned with the curriculum of The Odin Project. It provides a dedicated space for hands-on learning, experimentation, and implementation of concepts covered in the Ruby on Rails training. Note that this repository is intended for practicing and working on code that may involve more risk or experimental features.

## Working in Another Directory Initially

To avoid potential issues, it is recommended to work in a separate directory initially. Only exceptionally risky or experimental code should be placed in this repository. This approach helps maintain the stability of the primary project structure and ensures a clean and organized codebase.

## Project Structure

The directory structure follows a standard Ruby on Rails project layout, including but not limited to:

- **/app**: Contains the core application code, including models, views, controllers, and other essential components.

- **/config**: Houses configuration files for the Rails application.

- **/db**: Manages database-related files and migrations.

- **/public**: Holds static assets that do not require processing, such as images or stylesheets.

- **/test**: Includes test files and suites for testing the application.

- **/vendor**: Reserved for third-party code and libraries.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Ruby-on-Rails.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Ruby-on-Rails
   ```

3. Begin working on your Ruby on Rails projects within this repository.

4. If working on riskier or experimental code, consider creating a separate directory to maintain the integrity of the primary project structure.

## Contributing

Contributions to this practice directory are encouraged. If you have improvements, fixes, or additional features to share:

1. Fork the repository.

2. Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```

3. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add my feature"
   ```

4. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-feature
   ```

5. Open a pull request to the `main` branch of the original repository.
